# Scanner: Efficient Video Analysis at Scale [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scanner-research/scanner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scanner-research/scanner) #

Scanner is a system for developing applications that efficiently process large video datasets. Scanner applications can run on a multi-core laptop, a server packed with multiple GPUs, or a large number of machines in the cloud. Scanner has been used for:
* **Labeling and data mining large video collections:**Â Scanner is in use at Stanford University as the compute engine for visual data mining applications that detect people, commercials, human poses, etc. in datasets as big as 70,000 hours of TV news (12 billion frames, 20 TB) or 600 feature length movies (106 million frames).
* **VR Video synthesis:** scaling the [Surround 360 VR video stitching software](https://github.com/scanner-research/Surround360), which processes fourteen 2048x2048 input videos to produce 8k stereo video output.

To learn more about Scanner, see the documentation below or read the SIGGRAPH 2018 Technical Paper: "[Scanner: Efficient Video Analysis at Scale](http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/scanner/scanner_sig18.pdf)" by Poms, Crichton, Hanrahan, and Fatahalian.

## Key Features

Scanner's key features include:
* **Computation graphs designed for video processing:** Similar to the execution model used by many modern ML frameworks, creating a Scanner application involves composing together functions (called Scanner Ops) into a dataflow graph. Scanner graphs process sequences of video frames. Scanner graphs support features useful for video processing, such as the ability to sparsely sample frames from a video, access to temporal sliding windows of frames, and propagate state across computations on successive frames (e.g., tracking). The Scanner runtime schedules computation graphs efficiently onto one or many machines.
* **Random access to video frames:** Since Scanner's video data store has first-class knowledge of video formats, it can provide fast *random* access to compressed video frames.  This feature has proven useful in video data analytics applications that want to access a sparse set of frames from a video.
* **First-class support for GPU acceleration:** Most image processing algorithms can benefit greatly from GPU execution, so Scanner provides first-class support for writing Ops that utilize GPU execution. Scanner also leverages specialized GPU hardware for video decoding when available.
* **Distributed execution:** Scanner can scale out applications to hundreds of machines, and is designed to be fault tolerant, so your applciations can use cheaper preemptible machines on cloud computing platforms.

Scanner __is not__ a new system for implementing new high-performance image and video processing kernels from scratch.  However, Scanner can be used to create scalable video processing applications by composing kernels that already exist as part of popular libraries such as OpenCV, Caffe, TensorFlow, etc. or have been implemented in popular languages like Cuda or Halide.

## Example code

Scanner applications are written using our Python API. Here's an example
application that resizes every third frame from a video and then saves the result as an mp4 video (our
[Quickstart](http://scanner.run/quickstart.html) walks through this
example in more detail):

```python
from scannerpy import Database, Job

# Ingest a video into the database (create a table with a row per video frame)
db = Database()
db.ingest_videos([('example_table', 'example.mp4')])

# Define a Computation Graph
frame = db.sources.FrameColumn()                                    # Read sequence of frames from the database as input
sampled_frame = db.streams.Stride(input=frame, stride=3)            # Select every third frame
resized = db.ops.Resize(frame=sampled_frame, width=640, height=480) # Resize input frames
output_frame = db.sinks.Column(columns={'frame': resized})          # Save resized frames as new video

# Set parameters of computation graph ops
job = Job(op_args={
    frame: db.table('example_table').column('frame'), # Column to read input frames from
    output_frame: 'resized_example'                   # Name the table that will hold the computation's output
})

# Execute the computation graph and return a handle to the newly produced tables
output_tables = db.run(output=output_frame, jobs=[job], force=True)

# Save the resized video as an mp4 file
output_tables[0].column('frame').save_mp4('resized_video')
```

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the development of Scanner, you should first
build Scanner [from source](http://scanner.run/from_source.html).

Please submit a pull-request rebased against the most recent version of the
master branch and we will review your changes to be merged. Thanks for
contributing!

### Running tests
You can run our full suite of tests by executing `make test` in the directory
you used to build Scanner. This will run both our C++ tests and our end-to-end
tests that verify the python API.

## About
Scanner is an active research project, part of a collaboration between Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University. Please contact [Alex Poms](https://github.com/apoms) and [Will Crichton](https://github.com/willcrichton) with questions.

Scanner was developed with the support of the NSF (IIS-1539069), the Intel Corporation (through the Intel Science and Technology Center for Visual Cloud Computing and the NSF/Intel VEC program), and by Google.
