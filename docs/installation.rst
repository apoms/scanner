Installation
============

Scanner has out-of-the-box compatibility with frameworks like OpenCV and Caffe, but the flip side is that installing all of the dependencies can take a long time. The easiest way to get started with Scanner is using our pre-built :ref:`docker` images, but we also support :ref:`from_source`.
